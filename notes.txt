10 stations 
nodal distance of 200 meters (ND)
transmission rate of 5Mbps (TR)
packet size of 1000 bit (Bits)
propagation speed is 2 x 108 m/s (PS)


Calculate data Throughput and channel Utililisation



Plan: 

take user input for packet size in bits (Bits), transmission rate (TR),  nodal distance (ND) and stations (STAT)

needs to output Throughput (T) and Utililisation (U)

DBS (Distance between end stations)
end nodes distance 
CDBES = ND(N - 1)

propergation delay 
CPD = CDBES/PS

transmission time (TT)
CTT =  ( (PB + 8 + 14 + 4) / PB) / TR

Utililisation (U)
U = PD / TT

Throughput (T)

CBPS = Bits/s

CBPS = U * TR

T = CBPS/8
